$$BDP = Bandwidth * RTT$$

In [data communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communications "Data communications"), the **bandwidth-delay product** is the [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") of a [data link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link "Data link")'s capacity (in [bits per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate "Bit rate")) and its [round-trip delay time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time "Round-trip delay time") (in seconds).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth-delay_product#cite_note-1) The result, an amount of data measured in bits (or [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte")), is equivalent to the maximum amount of data on the network circuit at any given time, i.e., data that has been transmitted but not yet acknowledged.
